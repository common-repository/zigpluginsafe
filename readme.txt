ZigPluginSafe allows the admin who first activates it to prevent other admins from editing, deactivating or deleting selected plugins.

== Description ==

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS THE LAST VERSION. WE ARE RETIRING THIS PLUGIN.**

This plugin allows the administrator who installed and first activated it to prevent other users (even administrators) from editing, deactivating or deleting plugins.

All selected plugins have their deactivate and delete links removed on the Plugins page. In addition, EVERY plugin has its edit link removed, if it has one.

Please note that if another administrator has access to the database, they could manually change the plugin's settings. However, the purpose of this plugin is to discourage a developer's non-technical clients from disabling plugins themselves even if they insist on having an admin account, and it should be proof enough against that.

Compatible with ClassicPress.
